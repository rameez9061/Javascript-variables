console.log("This repo is for learning about the variables in javascript");
let a =45;
console.log(a);

//variables can only be started with $ letters , digits , and underscores
let $name = "Rameez";
console.log($name);

// variables cannnot be start with numbers it will throw an error

let 5name = "Arshad";
// This code will give a syntax error

// Another rule is that javascript reserved keywords cannot be used as javascript variables 

let var = 5;
// this will give syntax error because var is a reserved keyword in javascript

// last one is that javascript is a case sensitive language 
let harry  = "boy";
let Harry = "man";
console.log(harry);
console.log(Harry);
// both keywords are same for us but different for javascript
